# deep_asteroid_classifier

Initial runs were trying to tune hyper parameters for very small dataset we have

#experiment 1

adjusted learning rate function (which definitely helped smoothen loss curve but it is still rough); will keep the functionality as it may come in handy later on

#experiment 2

Raising epoch num obviously helps convergence and lowers overall loss, but overfitting is something to be aware of with such a small dataset
